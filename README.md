# Streaming Finance Data with AWS Lambda
### Introduction
For this project, we are tasked with provisioning a few Lambda functions to generate near real time finance data records 
for downstream processing and interactive querying.

### Infrastructure
This project consists of three major infrastructure elements that work in tandem:
1. A lambda function that collects our data (DataCollector)
1. A lambda function that transforms and places data into S3 (DataTransformer)
1. A serverless process that allows us to query our s3 data (DataAnalyzer)

### AWS Glue and Athena

We will then configure AWS Glue, pointing it to the S3 Bucket you created in our DataTransformer. This will allow us to now interactively query the S3 files generated by the DataTransformer using AWS Athena to gain insight into our streamed data. This process is also known as the DataAnalyzer.
